% Demonstration of a method based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and
% mass-spring-damper system to learn and reproduce the dynamics of a set 
% of motions. 
% This source code is the implementation of the algorithms described in 
% Section 5.1, p.130 of the book "Robot Programming by Demonstration: A 
% Probabilistic Approach".

% The program first encapsulates the motion dynamics in a Gaussian Mixture
% Model (GMM) estimating locally the joint distribution P(x,dx) of
% position 'x' and velocity 'dx' variables. 
% Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) is then used to retrieve at each 
% iteration a desired position 'X' and desired velocity 'DX' by knowing 
% the current position and velocity of the system. A mass-spring damper sytem 
% (impedance controller) of the form 'ddx*M+(dx-DX)*B+(x-X)*K=0' is then used 
% to reach for the desired position and desired velocity, which allows to 
% folllow the learned dynamics while coming back to desired trajecotry in 
% case of perturbations.

% This source code is given for free! However, I would be grateful if you refer 
% to the book (or corresponding article) in any academic publication that uses 
% this code or part of it. Here are the corresponding BibTex references:
